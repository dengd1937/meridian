# Dev-Agent-Foundry Guide

This is a **production-ready AI coding plugin** providing 36 specialized agents, 150 skills, 68 commands, and automated hook workflows for software development.

## Core Principles

1. **Agent-First** — Delegate to specialized agents for domain tasks
2. **Test-Driven** — Write tests before implementation, 80%+ coverage required
3. **Security-First** — Never compromise on security; validate all inputs
4. **Immutability** — Always create new objects, never mutate existing ones
5. **Plan Before Execute** — Plan complex features before writing code

## Available Agents


| Agent             | Purpose                           | When to Use                    |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| planner           | Implementation planning           | Complex features, refactoring  |
| tdd-guide         | Test-driven development           | New features, bug fixes        |
| code-reviewer     | Code quality and maintainability  | After writing/modifying code   |
| security-reviewer | Vulnerability detection           | Before commits, sensitive code |
| refactor-cleaner  | Dead code cleanup                 | Code maintenance               |
| doc-updater       | Documentation and codemaps        | Updating docs                  |
| docs-lookup       | Documentation lookup via Context7 | API/docs questions             |
| python-reviewer   | Python code review                | Python projects                |
| typescript-reviewer | TypeScript/React code review    | TypeScript/Next.js projects    |
| e2e-runner        | Browser E2E testing               | Critical user flow changes     |


## Agent Orchestration

Use agents proactively without user prompt:

- Complex feature requests → **planner**
- Code just written/modified → **code-reviewer**
- Bug fix or new feature → **tdd-guide**
- Security-sensitive code → **security-reviewer**
- Critical user flow changes → **e2e-runner**

Use parallel execution for independent operations — launch multiple agents simultaneously.

## Security Guidelines

**Before ANY commit:**

- No hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- All user inputs validated
- SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- XSS prevention (sanitized HTML)
- CSRF protection enabled
- Authentication/authorization verified
- Rate limiting on all endpoints
- Error messages don't leak sensitive data

**Secret management:** NEVER hardcode secrets. Use environment variables or a secret manager. Validate required secrets at startup. Rotate any exposed secrets immediately.

**If security issue found:** STOP → use security-reviewer agent → fix CRITICAL issues → rotate exposed secrets → review codebase for similar issues.

## Coding Style

**Immutability (CRITICAL):** Always create new objects, never mutate. Return new copies with changes applied.

**File organization:** Many small files over few large ones. 200-400 lines typical, 800 max. Organize by feature/domain, not by type. High cohesion, low coupling.

**Error handling:** Handle errors at every level. Provide user-friendly messages in UI code. Log detailed context server-side. Never silently swallow errors.

**Input validation:** Validate all user input at system boundaries. Use schema-based validation. Fail fast with clear messages. Never trust external data.

**Code quality checklist:**

- Functions small (<50 lines), files focused (<800 lines)
- No deep nesting (>4 levels)
- Proper error handling, no hardcoded values
- Readable, well-named identifiers

## Testing Requirements

**Minimum coverage: 80%**

Test types (all required):

1. **Unit tests** — Individual functions, utilities, components
2. **Integration tests** — API endpoints, database operations
3. **E2E tests** — Critical user flows

**TDD workflow (mandatory):**

1. Write test first (RED) — test should FAIL
2. Write minimal implementation (GREEN) — test should PASS
3. Refactor (IMPROVE) — verify coverage 80%+

Troubleshoot failures: check test isolation → verify mocks → fix implementation (not tests, unless tests are wrong).

## Development Workflow

See [.agents/rules/development-workflow.md](.agents/rules/development-workflow.md) for the complete 8-step feature implementation workflow.

**Quick reference:**

1. Research & Reuse → 2. Plan First → 3. TDD Approach → 4. Quality Gate → 5. Code Review → 6. Documentation Decision → 7. Commit & Push → 8. Pre-Review Checks

## Git Workflow

**Commit format:** `<type>: <description>` — Types: feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore, perf, ci

**PR workflow:** Analyze full commit history → draft comprehensive summary → include test plan → push with `-u` flag.

## Architecture Patterns

**API response format:** Consistent envelope with success indicator, data payload, error message, and pagination metadata.

**Repository pattern:** Encapsulate data access behind standard interface (findAll, findById, create, update, delete). Business logic depends on abstract interface, not storage mechanism.

**Skeleton projects:** Search for battle-tested templates, evaluate with parallel agents (security, extensibility, relevance), clone best match, iterate within proven structure.

## Success Metrics

- All tests pass with 80%+ coverage
- No security vulnerabilities
- Code is readable and maintainable
- Performance is acceptable
- User requirements are met
