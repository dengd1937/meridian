# L1 Lightweight UI Change

Use `L1` when **all** of the following are true:

- No new page or major layout pattern
- No new interaction model
- No new design-system component
- No new token is required

## Actions

1. Confirm the change is local and does not introduce new design primitives.
2. Capture before/after screenshots for the affected area.
3. Record a short note in `intent.md` or the PR description:
   - what changed
   - why it changed
   - which existing tokens/components were reused
4. Proceed directly to the development workflow Step 2 and Step 3.

## Outputs

- Updated screenshot(s) for the affected surface
- A short design note in `intent.md` or the PR

## Escalation Rule

If the change grows into a new page, new interaction, or new token, upgrade immediately to `L2` (full design-workflow skill V2-1 to V2-5).
